# Nocturna Wheel.js Refactoring Plan

## Code Quality Evaluation (6/10)

After examining the code structure, here's the evaluation:

The codebase shows a reasonably organized object-oriented approach to creating an astrological chart library, but has several issues:

**Positives:**
- Clear class separation with single responsibilities (renderers, utils, etc.)
- Decent documentation with JSDoc comments
- Proper error handling in constructor methods
- Chainable API design pattern
- Proper separation of concerns between different renderers

**Negatives:**
- Excessive console.log statements throughout the code
- Lack of proper dependency injection
- Some methods are very long and do multiple things
- Missing unit tests
- Inconsistent error handling
- No TypeScript/strong typing
- Some architecture issues like tight coupling between components

## Improvement Recommendation

The most important yet small task to improve the code would be to **implement a proper EventEmitter/Observer pattern** to decouple the renderers from the main NocturnaWheel class.

### Plan:

1. Create a new EventBus class in `src/core/EventBus.js`:
   - Implement standard methods: `on()`, `off()`, `emit()`
   - Support event namespacing for better organization

2. Modify `NocturnaWheel.js` to:
   - Use the EventBus for communication between components
   - Emit events on important state changes (render, update, etc.)
   - Pass the EventBus instance to all renderers during initialization

3. Update renderers to:
   - Subscribe to relevant events instead of being directly called
   - Emit their own events when needed (e.g., when rendering is complete)
   - Reduce direct dependencies on other components

This change would:
- Reduce coupling between components
- Make the code more testable
- Allow for easier extension with new components
- Simplify debugging by providing a central place to monitor state changes
- Improve reusability of renderer components
- Make the codebase more maintainable by reducing interdependencies

The task is relatively small (could be implemented in ~100-150 lines of code) yet would provide significant architectural benefits, particularly for future maintenance and extension.
